== RSpec unit tests

The rspec tests are to be run in situ on the VM. There is some futzing required
to set up the database. You have to copy your production db config overwriting
the test config:

    kato config get --yaml aok database_environment/production |\ kato config
    set --yaml aok database_environment/test

and change the db name to something like aok_test:

    kato config set aok database_environment/test/database aok_test

Then set up the database:

    RACK_ENV=test bundle exec rake db:recreate

and you're ready to run the tests:

    bundle exec rake spec


== Java Integration Tests

You must have ActiveState's UAA repo cloned next to AOK in the filesystem. There
are probably some java prereqs also (like maven). Please update this as you
discover what else needs to be installed for the tests to run.

On the VM, run `rake test:setup` to configure the VM

On your workstation, run `rake test:integration` to run the tests. Use `rake test:results` to view the results (failures and skips) of the test.
